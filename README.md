# PRODIGY_DS_TASK_3 - Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
I have completed Task-03 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech! ðŸš€
For this project, I built a decision tree classifier using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
